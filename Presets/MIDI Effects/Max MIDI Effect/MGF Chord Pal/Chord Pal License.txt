This is not an educational device, bank names are approximations. 
No complaining about "but this bank is called blah blah when it should be called blah blah" I don't care.
This device is a beta version and may not function as expected. Please report bugs to:

mgfaudio@gmail.com

Current bugs / issues:

Sequencer doesn't always print to MIDI as expected but works for most things

Performance can be a bit "sticky" when using your qwerty keyboard as a MIDI keyboard. Click out of the device onto a blank track for better performance when using "Computer MIDI Keyboard" in Live.

Custom preset banks don't save into the device, use export / import and save over ChordPalDefault.json
